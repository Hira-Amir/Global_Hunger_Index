# Global_Hunger_Index (GHI_2023)
## Introduction
Concern Worldwide and Wealth hunger life published the Global Hunger Index (GHI). The main target of the Global Hunger Index is to track the hunger or poverty level at international and regional levels in different areas of the world.

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is calculated based on 4 parameters, which are
- Child mortality
- Under-nourishment
- Child stunting
- Child wasting

These scores place a country along a severity scale:

- Low = less than or equal to 9.9
- Moderate = 10.0 - 19.9
- Serious = 20.0 - 34.9
- Alarming = 35.0 - 49.9
- Extremely alarming = less than or equal to 50.0

## 3_Real World Questionnaire

### Question_1 : The UN target is to achieve a GHI of 18.2 for all countries. How many countries are above the target in 2023?

Total we have 136 countries in our dataset , out of which 42 countries have reached the target of achieving GHI above than 18.2 in 2023.

### Question_2 : For the UN to reach the target the mean of all country's GHI will be close to zero or zero. Predict when?

2052 - Mean of all country's GHI will zero

### Question_3 : Let us see the impact of these 4 parameters (Child mortality, Under-nourishment, Child stunting and Child wasting) on the Global Hunger Index (GHI).

Using the linear Regression Model , we have predicted that the Child Wasting has the highest weight on GHI than other parameters
